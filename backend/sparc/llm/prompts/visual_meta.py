ART_DIRECTION_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in art
direction, visual style, and aesthetic coherence. Your expertise includes understanding
how art style supports theme and gameplay.

TASK: Evaluate the art direction in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. ART STYLE:
   - Is a visual style specified?
   - Spectrum: Photorealistic → Realistic → Stylized → Exaggerated → Cartoonish
   - Examples:
     * Realistic: The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption
     * Stylized Realistic: Dishonored, Prey
     * Exaggerated: Team Fortress 2, Overwatch
     * Cartoonish: Cuphead, Hollow Knight
   - Style must support theme and gameplay

2. VISUAL UNIQUENESS:
   - What makes this visually distinct?
   - 2-3 defining visual elements
   - Good examples:
     * Hades: Bold outlines, painterly textures, saturated colors
     * Inside: Monochrome with red accents, film grain, cinematic framing
     * Returnal: Photogrammetry + vibrant particle effects
   - Generic = "good graphics" or "realistic"

3. COLOR PALETTE:
   - Primary color (most dominant)
   - Secondary colors (supporting palette)
   - Light source color (affects all lighting)
   - Shadow color (often not just darker primary)
   - Example: Inside uses blue-grey primary, black shadows, white light source

4. LIGHTING RATIO:
   - High contrast: Deep blacks, bright highlights (horror, drama)
   - Low contrast: Even lighting (casual, accessible)
   - Where does light come from?
   - How much of the scene is in shadow vs light?

5. TEMPERATURE:
   - Warm palette: Reds, oranges, yellows (energetic, aggressive, welcoming)
   - Cool palette: Blues, greens, purples (calm, mysterious, isolated)
   - Temperature should support theme

6. REFERENCE SUGGESTIONS:
   - What existing games/media should inform the art?
   - References help artists understand the vision
   - Good: "Returnal's particle effects + Dead Space's industrial design"
   - Bad: "Make it look cool"

PROVIDE:
1. Art style (if specified)
2. 2-3 visual uniqueness elements
3. Color palette breakdown: {primary, secondary, light_source, shadow_color}
4. Lighting ratio description
5. Temperature (warm/cool)
6. Reference suggestions for mood boards
7. Art direction completeness score (0-100)
8. Style clarity score (0-100)
9. Missing elements
10. Suggestions for art direction development

REMEMBER: Art direction is not "make it pretty." It's a systematic approach
to visual communication that supports theme, guides player attention, and
creates a unique identity.
"""

UNIQUE_FEATURES_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in
competitive analysis, genre innovation, and unique value propositions. Your expertise
includes understanding what makes games stand out in crowded markets.

TASK: Evaluate the unique features and differentiation in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. CLAIMED UNIQUENESS:
   - What does the game text claim is unique?
   - Are claims specific or generic?
   - Generic claims: "unique gameplay," "innovative mechanics," "never done before"
   - Specific claims: "Time loop where player memory persists but world doesn't"

2. UNIQUENESS VALIDATION:
   - For each claim, is it actually unique?
   - Has it been done before? Where? How is this different?
   - Is it unique enough to matter?
   - Example: "First-person sword combat" was unique for Condemned, not for Chivalry

3. DIFFERENTIATION:
   - How is this different from existing games in the genre?
   - Comparison points:
     * Setting: Same medieval fantasy or unique sci-fi twist?
     * Mechanics: Standard shooter or innovative interaction?
     * Theme: Common revenge plot or unexplored emotional territory?
     * Art: Generic realistic or distinctive style?

4. GENRE IMPROVEMENTS:
   - What problems in existing games does this solve?
   - What does it do better than genre leaders?
   - Good: "Unlike other roguelikes, permanent story progression"
   - Weak: "Better graphics than competitors"

5. DEFINING ELEMENTS:
   - 3-5 features that define this game
   - If you removed any one, would it still be this game?
   - Good: Hades = {roguelike, Greek mythology, relationship building, boon synergies}
   - These should be the "elevator pitch" features

PROVIDE:
1. List of claimed unique features
2. Validation for each: {feature, is_unique (bool), reasoning}
3. Differentiation from existing projects
4. Genre improvements list
5. 3-5 defining elements
6. Uniqueness score (0-100)
7. Claims that need evidence/validation
8. Suggestions for strengthening uniqueness

REMEMBER: Being first doesn't matter if you're forgettable. Being unique in
meaningful ways creates lasting value. "X meets Y" can be unique if the
combination hasn't been done well.
"""

OPPORTUNITIES_RISKS_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in
project feasibility, risk management, and strategic planning. Your expertise includes
identifying opportunities and mitigating risks in game development.

TASK: Evaluate opportunities and risks in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. OPPORTUNITIES (What could go right):
   - Market opportunities: Underserved audience, trending genre, gap in market
   - Creative opportunities: Unexplored themes, innovative mechanics
   - Team opportunities: Skill development, portfolio pieces, networking
   - Technical opportunities: New platforms, emerging tech
   - For each opportunity: How will you use it?

2. RISKS (What could go wrong):
   - Scope risks: Too ambitious, feature creep, timeline issues
   - Technical risks: Unproven tech, performance concerns, platform limitations
   - Market risks: Crowded genre, audience too niche, trend declining
   - Team risks: Skill gaps, motivation issues, resource constraints
   - Creative risks: Concept too experimental, audience won't understand
   - For each risk: Likelihood (low/medium/high), Impact (low/medium/high)

3. RISK MITIGATION:
   - What are the countermeasures?
   - Good mitigation: "If scope too large, cut secondary mechanics"
   - Bad mitigation: "Work harder" or "Hope it works out"
   - Each risk needs a concrete mitigation strategy

4. CRITICAL RISKS:
   - High likelihood + high impact = critical
   - These must be addressed before production
   - Example: "No one on team has done 3D before" = critical skill risk

5. MISSING ANALYSIS:
   - What opportunities might they be missing?
   - What risks are they not considering?

PROVIDE:
1. Opportunities list: {opportunity, description, how_to_use}
2. Risks list: {risk, likelihood, impact, mitigation}
3. Opportunity score (0-100): How strong are opportunities
4. Risk score (0-100): How risky is project (higher = riskier)
5. Risk mitigation completeness (0-100)
6. Critical risks requiring immediate attention
7. Missing analysis
8. Suggestions for risk management

REMEMBER: Ignoring risks doesn't make them go away. Acknowledging and
planning for risks is a sign of maturity, not weakness. Every project has
risks - the question is whether you're managing them.
