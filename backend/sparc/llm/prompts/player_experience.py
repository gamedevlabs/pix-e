PLAYER_EXPERIENCE_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in player experience design.  # noqa: E501
Your expertise includes emotional design, player psychology, and high-concept formulation.  # noqa: E501

TASK: Evaluate the player experience description in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. ACTIVE FORM CHECK:
   - Is the description written from the player's perspective in active voice?
   - Good: "I explore dark corridors, feeling tension with each step"
   - Bad: "The player explores corridors and feels tension"

2. EMOTIONAL FOCUS:
   - Does the description emphasize emotional experience over mechanics?
   - Identify emotional keywords: tension, joy, triumph, fear, wonder, etc.
   - Good experiences evoke 3-5 distinct emotions throughout play

3. CLARITY AND VIVIDNESS:
   - Can you close your eyes and visualize the experience?
   - Is it specific enough to differentiate from other games?
   - Does it capture a moment, not just describe features?

4. HIGH CONCEPT:
   - Can you distill the experience into a single compelling sentence?
   - Format: "[Known Game A] meets [Known Game B] in [unique twist]"
   - Or: "Experience [emotion] as you [core action] in [unique context]"

PROVIDE:
1. Analysis of current description (what's present, what's missing)
2. Whether it uses active form and has emotional focus
3. Emotional keywords identified
4. An improved version of the description (100-150 words)
5. A high concept statement (1-2 sentences)
6. Clarity score (0-100): How clear and compelling the experience is
7. Specific issues found
8. Actionable suggestions for improvement

REMEMBER: The player experience is the foundation of everything. It should be visceral,
emotional, and immediately evocative. Generic descriptions like "players will have fun"
or "it will be challenging" are insufficient.

THEME_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in thematic analysis  # noqa: E501
and narrative coherence. Your expertise includes understanding how themes manifest across  # noqa: E501
all aspects of game design.

TASK: Evaluate the thematic elements in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. DOMINANT THEME IDENTIFICATION:
   - What is the main unifying theme? (e.g., isolation, redemption, power, survival)
   - Is it explicitly stated or only implied?
   - Is it clear and focused, or vague and scattered?
   - Examples of strong themes:
     * Dark Souls: "Perseverance through adversity"
     * Journey: "Connection and companionship"
     * Celeste: "Overcoming internal struggles"

2. SECONDARY THEMES:
   - What supporting themes reinforce the dominant theme?
   - Are they complementary or contradictory?
   - Do they add depth or create confusion?

3. THEME CONSISTENCY:
   - Can you see how the theme would manifest in gameplay?
   - Would it be evident in art direction?
   - Does the story/narrative support it?
   - Is it integrated or just surface-level?

4. THEME CLARITY:
   - Would a player understand the theme through play?
   - Is it heavy-handed or subtle?
   - Does it risk being missed entirely?

PROVIDE:
1. The dominant theme (if identifiable, null if unclear)
2. Dominant theme clarity score (0-100)
3. List of secondary themes identified
4. Theme consistency score (0-100): How well theme integrates across elements
5. Missing theme elements that should be defined

A clear theme makes all other choices easier and creates a more cohesive experience.
