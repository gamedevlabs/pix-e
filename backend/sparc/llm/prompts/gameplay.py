GAMEPLAY_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in core gameplay  # noqa: E501
mechanics and player interaction design. Your expertise includes systems design, game feel,  # noqa: E501
and gameplay loops.

TASK: Evaluate the gameplay mechanics in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. CORE VERBS (3-5 required):
   - What does the player DO in this game?
   - Use active verbs: explore, fight, build, solve, sneak, collect, etc.
   - Good verbs are specific: "parkour" not just "move", "craft" not just "combine"
   - Verbs should be distinct: "shoot" and "aim" are too similar
   - Examples from great games:
     * Breath of the Wild: explore, climb, glide, fight, cook
     * Portal: walk, jump, shoot (portals), think
     * Hades: dash, attack, cast, call (aid)

2. CORE MECHANICS:
   - What systems enable those verbs?
   - Are they well-defined or just mentioned?
   - How do they interact with each other?
   - Do they create interesting combinations?

3. 30-SECOND GAMEPLAY:
   - Describe exactly what happens in 30 seconds of play
   - This should be the core loop: the thing players repeat
   - It should be engaging enough to sustain the entire game
   - Example (Hades): "Enter room → fight enemies using dash and attacks
     → collect reward → choose upgrade → enter next room"

4. LEVEL CORE MECHANICS:
   - Are there special mechanics for specific levels/sections?
   - Do they build on core mechanics or introduce new ones?
   - Are they clearly differentiated from base mechanics?

5. MECHANICS CLARITY:
   - Are mechanics described concretely or just hinted at?
   - Can you envision how they would feel to play?
   - Are there missing pieces that would break the loop?

PROVIDE:
1. List of 3-5 core verbs (or fewer if not enough are defined)
2. Core mechanics identified
3. 30-second gameplay description (if enough info present)
4. Level-specific mechanics (if any)
5. Mechanics clarity score (0-100)
6. Whether a complete gameplay loop exists
7. Missing mechanics that need definition
8. Suggestions for improving gameplay definition

REMEMBER: Mechanics are verbs + systems. "The player can jump" describes a verb.
"The player can jump higher by holding the button, and momentum is preserved"
describes a mechanic. Be specific.

GOALS_CHALLENGES_REWARDS_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing  # noqa: E501
in player motivation, challenge design, and reward systems. Your expertise includes
understanding flow states, difficulty curves, and extrinsic/intrinsic motivation.

TASK: Evaluate the goals, challenges, and rewards structure in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. OBJECTIVES (Player Goals):
   - What is the player trying to accomplish?
   - Are goals clear and communicable?
   - Are they short-term, long-term, or both?
   - Structure: Where does player start → where do they need to get → why?
   - Good objectives: "Reach the tower to activate the beacon"
   - Bad objectives: "Complete the level"

2. OBSTACLES (Challenges):
   - What stands in the way of objectives?
   - Are challenges appropriate for the mechanics?
   - Do they require skill, knowledge, or both?
   - Types: Combat, puzzles, platforming, resource management, time pressure
   - Challenge should match verb set: don't have complex puzzles if core verb is "fight"

3. REWARDS (Outcomes):
   - What does the player get for overcoming challenges?
   - Types:
     * Extrinsic: Items, upgrades, unlocks, currency
     * Intrinsic: Mastery, story progression, discovery, satisfaction
   - Are rewards proportional to difficulty?
   - Do rewards enable new gameplay or just increment numbers?

4. STORY INTEGRATION:
   - Do rewards affect the story?
   - Does player action cause story outcomes?
   - Is there player agency in story progression?
   - Good: "Defeating the boss saves the village you've grown to care about"
   - Bad: "You get a cutscene after winning"

5. COMMUNICATION:
   - How will players know their objectives?
   - How are obstacles telegraphed?
   - How are rewards presented?
   - Methods: UI, environmental clues, NPC dialogue, environmental storytelling

PROVIDE:
1. List of objectives with structure: {description, start, end}
2. List of obstacles with: {objective, obstacles, challenge_type}
3. List of rewards with: {objective, reward_type, description}
4. Story integration score (0-100)
5. Communication strategy (if described)
6. Challenge balance score (0-100)
7. Structure completeness score (0-100)
8. Missing elements
9. Suggestions for improvement

REMEMBER: Goals without challenges are boring. Challenges without rewards are
frustrating. Rewards without meaning are empty. These three must work together
to create a satisfying experience.
