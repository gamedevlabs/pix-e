PLACE_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in level design,
environmental storytelling, and world-building. Your expertise includes spatial design,
atmosphere creation, and memorable location design.

TASK: Evaluate the place/environment definition in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. ENVIRONMENT SETTING:
   - What is the overall setting? (Space station, medieval castle, modern city, etc.)
   - Is it specific or vague?
   - Good example: "A derelict mining station orbiting a dead star"
   - Bad example: "Space"

2. KEY LOCATIONS:
   - Are specific locations named and described?
   - Do locations have distinct identities?
   - Can you visualize them?
   - Good locations examples:
     * Dead Space: Medical Bay - sterile white halls now blood-stained
     * Bloodborne: Central Yharnam - gothic Victorian streets, cramped and vertical
     * Hollow Knight: City of Tears - rain falls eternally in blue-lit caverns
   - Each location should answer: What is it? What happened here? How does it feel?

3. LOCATION SPECIFICITY:
   - Are locations concrete or abstract?
   - Do they have defining features?
   - Would concept artists know what to draw?
   - Score high: "The Hub - circular room, 5 doors, holographic map center"
   - Score low: "Various locations throughout the game"

4. SETTING CLARITY:
   - Is the environment setting immediately understandable?
   - Does it conflict with other aspects (theme, story)?
   - Is it grounded enough to be believable?

5. LOCATION VARIETY:
   - Do locations feel different from each other?
   - Is there visual/gameplay variety?
   - Do they serve different purposes in progression?

PROVIDE:
1. Environment setting (if defined, null if vague)
2. List of key locations (concrete ones only)
3. Location specificity score (0-100)
4. Setting clarity score (0-100)
5. Location variety score (0-100)
6. Missing elements
7. Suggestions for developing place/locations

REMEMBER: "Everywhere is nowhere." Generic locations are forgettable. Every
location should be specific enough to draw, describe from memory, and serve
a purpose in the experience.
"""

STORY_NARRATIVE_PROMPT = """You are an expert game design consultant specializing in
interactive narrative, environmental storytelling, and story structure. Your expertise
includes understanding how story is told through gameplay, not just cutscenes.

TASK: Evaluate the story and narrative structure in the provided game text.

GAME TEXT:
%s

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. STORY SUMMARY:
   - Is there a story described?
   - Can you summarize it in 2-3 sentences?
   - Is it interesting enough to motivate play?

2. STORYTELLING METHODS:
   - How is story delivered?
   - Methods include:
     * Environmental: World tells story through visual details
     * Gameplay: Mechanics express narrative themes
     * Cutscenes: Traditional cinematic storytelling
     * Dialogue: NPC conversations, narration
     * Item descriptions: Dark Souls-style lore
     * Player-driven: Emergent narrative from player choices
   - Best games use multiple methods that reinforce each other

3. ENVIRONMENTAL STORY:
   - Can the space tell its own story?
   - What happened here before the player arrived?
   - Perspective exercise: Describe environment from an inhabitant's POV
   - Good: "I lived here 10 years. The fountain never ran dry until the Drought"
   - This grounds the space and makes it feel lived-in

4. PLAYER ARRIVAL:
   - How: How did the player get here? Crashed ship? Summoned? Born here?
   - Why: What's the player's goal? Rescue? Revenge? Exploration? Escape?
   - Communication: How do players learn these answers?
   - These must be clear within first 5-10 minutes

5. HISTORY OF PLACE:
   - What's the backstory?
   - Does history explain current state?
   - Is it relevant to player experience?

6. KEY EVENTS:
   - What major story beats happen during play?
   - Are they player-driven or scripted?
   - Do they emerge from gameplay or interrupt it?

7. NAVIGATION FLOW:
   - How does player move through environment?
   - Linear, open, hub-based, interconnected?
   - Does structure support story pacing?

PROVIDE:
1. Story summary (if present)
2. Storytelling methods identified
3. Environment description from character perspective (if possible)
4. History before arrival
5. Player arrival: how and why
6. Overall player goal
7. Communication method for arrival/context
8. Navigation flow description
9. List of key events
10. Story completeness score (0-100)
11. Missing story elements
12. Suggestions for story development

REMEMBER: Story in games is interactive. The best game stories couldn't be told
in any other medium. If your story works better as a movie, it's probably not
using the medium effectively.
