# pix:e Minimal Starter

Look at the wiki once we have one

## Setup

1. Install python
2. Install node.js
3. Run one of the following commands (currently, we are only supporting npm).

```bash
# npm
npm run install-all

# pnpm
pnpm run install-all

# yarn
yarn run install-all

# bun
bun run install-all
```

## Development Server

Start both backend on `http://localhost:8000` and frontend on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run start-all

# pnpm
pnpm run start-all

# yarn
yarn run start-all

# bun
bun run start-all
```
(For now, the start-all script runs with npm in the background)
